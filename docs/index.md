Haze is a library providing a 'glassmorphism' style blur for Compose.

Haze is built with [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/), meaning that it supports different platforms:

| Platform      | Supported        |
|---------------|------------------|
| Android       | ✅               |
| Desktop (JVM) | ✅               |
| iOS           | ✅               |
| Wasm          | ✅               |
| JS/Canvas     | ✅               |

You can also see it in action in the [Tivi app](https://github.com/chrisbanes/tivi):

## Versions

There are currently 2 different versions available: 0.7.x (stable) and 1.0.x (pre-release).

The 1.0.x release depends on Compose Multiplatform 1.7.0, currently pre-release, meaning that we need to wait for that to go
stable before Haze can go stable. The 1.0.x release also contains a near full re-write of how Haze works underneath. More information can be found on the [Migrating to 1.0](migrating-1.0.md) page.

## Acknowledgements

In previous versions, the Skia-backed implementation (used on iOS and Desktop) was heavily influenced by [Kirill Grouchnikov](https://www.pushing-pixels.org)'s explorations on Compose Desktop. He wrote about it in his [Shader based render effects in Compose Desktop with Skia](https://www.pushing-pixels.org/2022/04/09/shader-based-render-effects-in-compose-desktop-with-skia.html) blog post.

The Android implementation was inspired by the techniques documented by [Chet Haase](https://twitter.com/chethaase) and [Nader Jawad](https://twitter.com/nadewad) in the [RenderNode for Bigger, Better Blurs](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/rendernode-for-bigger-better-blurs-ced9f108c7e2) blog post.

Thank you all.
