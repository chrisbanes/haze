# Benchmark results

The latest available Android measurements for each comparison are collected here. Use the
[performance guide](performance.md) to choose what to try on your screen, and the
[benchmark runbook][benchmark-runbook] to reproduce Haze's workloads. Sections use different
devices and builds: compare configurations within a table, not timings across sections.

## Reading the results

- **CPU frame duration** measures UI-thread and RenderThread cost, not GPU shader duration.
- **Frame overrun** measures how far a frame finishes past its deadline. Negative values mean
  spare time; more negative is better.
- **P90** describes the slower end of the measured frames. Negative P90 overrun does not mean
  every frame met its deadline.

These are measurements of specific sample workloads, not performance budgets for other apps.
Each section records its aggregation method and measurement conditions.

## Evidence artifacts

The raw JSON, benchmark messages, and Perfetto traces named in the measurement details were not
present in this checkout, so no durable downloadable bundle or checksum manifest can be prepared
from them. This affects the performance-mode calibration and native Android Backdrop comparisons;
the tables remain qualified summaries, not downloadable raw evidence.

To recover downloadable evidence, rerun the documented physical-device workload at the recorded
revision, archive each complete method with `internal/benchmark/archive_result.py`, then publish a
bundle and checksum manifest through an authorized delivery process. Do not treat emulator coverage
or an incomplete archive as physical-device acceptance.

## Performance modes

This comparison measures `Adaptive`, `Quality`, `Balanced`, and `Performance` with stable
and continuously changing source input. It used a Pixel 8a running Android 17 (full SDK 37.2)
at 60 Hz, with fixed-performance mode enabled and normal Android CPU scheduling.

Values are **P90 CPU frame duration / P90 frame overrun**, in milliseconds, from one pass with
eight iterations per method. Other style choices stay fixed within each sample.

### Blur

| Workload | Adaptive | Quality | Balanced | Performance |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Stable source | 5.16 / -7.27 | 4.38 / -7.64 | 5.41 / -7.40 | 3.20 / -8.52 |
| Continuously changing source | 4.66 / -6.15 | 4.72 / -4.98 | 4.49 / -6.07 | 5.03 / -6.28 |

### Glass

| Workload | Adaptive | Quality | Balanced | Performance |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Stable source | 3.99 / -10.41 | 3.45 / -10.74 | 3.27 / -10.78 | 3.90 / -10.37 |
| Continuously changing source | 4.21 / -8.76 | 3.51 / -1.68 | 4.90 / -4.98 | 4.59 / -8.62 |

All configurations had spare time at P90. For changing-input Glass, `Balanced` left about
5 ms of deadline margin, compared with 1.7 ms for `Quality`. `Performance` used roughly
9% less median peak GPU memory than `Quality`.

!!! warning "A single pass is not a mode ranking"

    Changing-input CPU timings did not produce a consistent ranking. Glass `Quality` had
    the lowest CPU P90 but the least deadline margin; the CPU metric alone cannot explain
    GPU cost. This forward-order pass does not control order effects or CPU placement.
    Compare appearance and repeat measurements on your screen before choosing an override.

??? info "Measurement details"

    The `benchmarkRelease` build used commit `d1d12494`; the Android build was
    `CP41.260814.003.B1`. The device was on AC power at 100% charge and reported thermal
    status 0 before and after the matrix. Brightness was unchanged and not recorded.
    Glass kept the other `GlassDefaults` values unchanged.

    The 16 methods produced 128 measured iterations and 128 Perfetto traces. Order was
    Blur stable, Blur changing, Glass stable, then Glass changing; each group ran
    Adaptive, Quality, Balanced, then Performance.

    A combined method selector executed only the first method. Its clean eight-iteration
    result was retained; all remaining methods were invoked and verified individually.
    An earlier attempt affected by a stale Google-app Chromium trace producer was stopped
    and replaced. The Google app was restored after measurement.

    Blur rows did not all record GPU memory. Raw JSON, benchmark messages, and traces are
    retained locally under
    `internal/benchmark/build/benchmark-results/performance-levels-latest/`.

    [ADR-0006][performance-mode-adr] for the public terminology.

## Backdrop versus Sources

Native Android Backdrop reads pixels behind the effect from the window, instead of using
captured `hazeSource` content. See [Backdrop guidance](performance.md#backdrop-input) for
its practical benefits, fallback requirements, and experimental feature flag.

This comparison used `Quality` on a Pixel 8a running Android 17 (full SDK 37.2) at 60 Hz,
with fixed-performance mode enabled and normal CPU scheduling. Each method ran eight
iterations in each of two passes, reversing both method and workload order.

Values are the **arithmetic mean of the two per-pass P90s**, not the P90 of pooled frames.

| Quality workload | Sources CPU P90 (ms) | Backdrop CPU P90 (ms) | Backdrop CPU difference | Sources overrun P90 (ms) | Backdrop overrun P90 (ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Blur, stable input | 4.59 | 5.07 | 10% higher | -7.75 | -2.44 |
| Blur, changing input | 4.59 | 5.12 | 12% higher | -5.40 | -2.21 |
| Glass, stable input | 3.54 | 5.18 | 46% higher | -10.69 | -0.48 |
| Glass, changing input | 3.46 | 4.24 | 23% higher | -1.84 | -0.48 |
| Nine Glass nodes, changing input | 3.94 | 4.74 | 20% higher | -6.85 | -5.18 |

Backdrop had higher CPU P90 in both passes for changing-input Blur and all Glass workloads.
All rows retained negative P90 overrun, but Backdrop left less deadline margin. Stable Blur's
ranking reversed between passes, so its average does not establish a consistent difference.

!!! note "Stable input is not an idle screen"

    These workloads continuously invalidate the effect while leaving source pixels unchanged.
    They compare retained source output with repeated native Backdrop composition.
    Use the changing-input rows as the closer reference for scrolling or animated content.
    These results do not establish that Backdrop is slower on every screen.

??? info "Measurement details"

    The `benchmarkRelease` build used commit `f06cd64a`; the Android build was
    `CP41.260814.003.B1`. The device was on AC power at 100% charge. The first pass started
    at thermal status 0 and battery temperature 26.0°C; after cooling, the reverse pass
    started at thermal status 0 and 28.1°C. Brightness was unchanged and not recorded.

    Ten methods, eight iterations each, and two passes produced 160 measured iterations and
    160 Perfetto traces. The first pass ran Sources then Backdrop for each workload.
    One interrupted second-pass attempt was replaced; no completed comparison was discarded.
    The Google app was force-stopped to prevent its Chromium trace producer from adding a
    known collection delay. Table values and percentage differences were calculated before
    rounding.

    Native Backdrop trace counters were present with zero source records, confirming that
    the native rows did not measure source fallback. Backdrop also used less peak GPU memory:
    the recorded difference was approximately 6–10 MB, based on the mean of each pass's
    median `memoryGpuMaxKb` value.

    Perfetto showed scheduler variation: the mean per-iteration RenderThread time share on
    the little CPU cluster ranged from 0.9% to 49.6% across method executions. Stable Glass
    remained slower with comparable placement in the first pass and more favourable
    Backdrop placement in the reverse pass. This supports a narrower conclusion: native
    Backdrop was not a CPU performance win for this Glass scene on this device.

    Raw JSON, benchmark messages, and traces are retained locally under
    `internal/benchmark/build/pixel8a-2026-09-12-full-backdrop-2pass/`.

## Glass fixed quality

This comparison isolates six `qualityFraction` settings for one 280 dp × 180 dp Regular
Glass surface using `HazeInput.Sources`. It used a Pixel 6 running Android 17 (full SDK 37.1)
at 60 Hz, with fixed-performance mode enabled.

!!! warning "Controlled CPU placement"

    The sample's main thread and RenderThread were restricted to the middle CPU cluster.
    These are controlled quality comparisons, not expected timings under normal Android
    scheduling. Do not combine them with the Pixel 8a mode results above.

The table shows **changing-input** results. Each value is the arithmetic mean of two
per-pass P90s, calculated before rounding, not the P90 of pooled frames.

| `qualityFraction` | CPU frame duration: mean per-pass P90 (ms) | Frame overrun: mean per-pass P90 (ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `0` | 3.17 | -10.95 |
| `0.25` | 3.12 | -10.17 |
| `1f / 3f` | 3.11 | -9.77 |
| `0.5` (`Balanced`) | 3.17 | -9.11 |
| `0.75` | 4.87 | -6.34 |
| `1` (`Quality`) | 4.74 | -5.53 |

For this scene, `Fixed(0.75f)` left 2.77 ms less deadline margin than `Balanced`.
No measured frame missed its deadline. These results do not establish the right setting
for Web, Clear Glass, larger or multiple surfaces, or higher refresh rates. Check both
appearance and frame timing on the actual screen under normal scheduling.

??? info "Measurement details"

    The sweep used a release build. The sample process requested affinity to CPUs 4–5;
    every Perfetto trace confirmed that main and RenderThread executed only on those CPUs
    during measurement. Other Android processes remained unrestricted.

    Six levels ran with stable and changing input, first in ascending quality order, then
    descending with workload order reversed. Eight iterations per case produced 192
    iterations and 34,753 measured frames. No completed timing iteration was discarded.
    Runs started at thermal status 0 and a battery temperature at most 30°C. Brightness
    was fixed during measurement; cooldowns dimmed the screen and disabled fixed-performance
    mode.

    The largest changing-input CPU P90 difference between passes was 0.12 ms. Stable-input
    CPU P90 ranged from 2.60 to 2.72 ms across all levels and both passes.

    An earlier normal-scheduling experiment showed CPU rankings sensitive to slower-core
    placement, including a reversed ranking when two levels were repeated. That experiment
    remains in git history. This controlled sweep also fixed brightness, so differences
    between the experiments cannot be attributed to CPU affinity alone.

## Representative workloads

These Glass sample measurements cover paging, an animated timeline, and steady-state scenes
with different effect counts. They used a Pixel 6 running Android 17/API 37 at 60 Hz, with
locked CPU frequency and eight iterations per scenario.

| Scenario | Workload | P90 CPU frame duration |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `productPager` | Gallery paging journey | 7.5 ms |
| `playgroundTimeline` | Gallery animated timeline journey | 11.2 ms |
| `steadyFull` | Controlled steady state, 1 Glass effect | 5.6 ms |
| `steadyFull3` | Controlled steady state, 3 Glass effects | 5.2 ms |
| `steadyFull9` | Controlled steady state, 9 Glass effects | 8.1 ms |

The Gallery journeys are closer to visible user interactions than the steady-state controls.
The effect-count rows are separate workload measurements, not a per-effect cost formula:
three effects were not slower than one in this run. Measure the content and interactions your
application actually uses.

??? info "Measurement details"

    The `benchmarkRelease` build used commit `334557df`. Display resolution was 1080×2400
    and render rate was locked to 60 Hz.

    Cold-initialization `effectAttach*` results are omitted because they attach effects at
    the measurement boundary and diagnose delegate/shader creation rather than representative
    interactions. They remain covered by the [benchmark runbook][benchmark-runbook].
